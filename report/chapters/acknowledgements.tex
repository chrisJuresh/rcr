Everything we do is a collaborative effort of hundreds of people, from those we come across in our personal lives to the developers who create the tools we rely on. I extend gratitude to them all. 

However, there are a few people who have had such a significant impact on my life that they deserve personal recognition directly from me.

The reassurance of having a knowledgable and supportive supervisor was invaluable. Dr. Fabrizio Smeraldi provided me with detailed feedback, answered all of my queries, motivated me with his positive affirmations, and offered infinite guidance. 

Without the work of all the staff at the Royal College of Radiologists, this project could not have been conceived. I am particularly grateful to Lucy Horder for bringing me on board the Professional Services team, and to Donna Barry for her training on Job Descriptions and Advisory Appointment Committees.

Most importantly, I thank my friends, family, and partner for their unwavering love and support throughout my entire degree.
