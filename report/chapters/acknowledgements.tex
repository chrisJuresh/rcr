\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Fabrizio Smeraldi for his guidance and support throughout the project. I would also like to thank Dr Paulo Oliva for introducing me to django, as well as Vue3, which showed me the wonders of non-JSX frameworks, leading me to discover SvelteKit. I give a general thank you to all the other staff in the EECS department who made all of this possible. Finally, and most importantly, I would like to thank my family, friends, and partner for supporting me throughout my entire degree.
